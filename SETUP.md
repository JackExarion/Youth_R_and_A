- Export options:
  - **Export Attendance** (Attendance page): downloads a CSV for the selected Sunday with columns: Member Name, Email, Phone, Registered At, New Member?, Present/Absent. The member list is fetched live, so new members appear automatically and absent members are clearly marked.
  - **Export Members** (Members page): exports the current member directory as CSV.
